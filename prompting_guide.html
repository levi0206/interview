    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The GPT-4 Prompting Guide helps you craft effective prompts for OpenAI's GPT-4 to get the best results. Below are various techniques, examples, and tips to make the most of GPT-4.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="principles">
    <h2>Principles of Effective Prompting</h2>
    <p>To get the most out of GPT-4, it's essential to follow some key principles:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Be Specific:</strong> The clearer and more specific your instructions are, the better the output.</li>
      <li><strong>Provide Context:</strong> Help GPT-4 understand the situation by including relevant details.</li>
      <li><strong>Output Format:</strong> If you want structured outputs like lists or tables, specify the format.</li>
      <li><strong>Keep It Simple:</strong> Avoid ambiguity in your instructions.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

    <h2>Prompting Techniques</h2>
    <p>Here are some of the most common and effective techniques to improve GPT-4's response:</p>

    <h3>1. Instruction-Based Prompting</h3>
    <p>Provide clear, direct instructions to tell GPT-4 exactly what you want.</p>
    <pre>
      Example: "Write a short summary of the novel '1984' by George Orwell."
    </pre>

    <h3>2. Chain-of-Thought Prompting</h3>
    <p>Encourage GPT-4 to reason step-by-step through the problem by asking for intermediate reasoning.</p>
    <pre>
      Example: "What are the benefits of exercise? Explain in steps."
    </pre>

    <h3>3. Few-Shot Prompting</h3>
    <p>Provide a few examples to help GPT-4 understand the desired output style or format.</p>
    <pre>
      Example: "Translate the following sentences into French:
      - 'Hello, how are you?'
      - 'I am learning French.'"
    </pre>

    <h3>4. Zero-Shot Prompting</h3>
    <p>Ask GPT-4 to perform a task without any examples, but with clear instructions.</p>
    <pre>
      Example: "Write a poem about the sea."
    </pre>

    <h3>5. System Messages</h3>
    <p>Use special system messages to adjust the behavior of GPT-4.</p>
    <pre>
      Example: "You are a helpful assistant. Please answer all questions concisely."
    </pre>

  <section id="advanced-tips">
    <h2>Advanced Tips for Better Results</h2>
    <p>For more advanced users, here are additional strategies to refine your prompts and outputs:</p>

    <h3>1. Refine Prompts Iteratively</h3>
    <p>Start with a basic prompt and refine it over time based on the results you get. This will help you fine-tune your requests.</p>

    <h3>2. Be Explicit About Assumptions</h3>
    <p>If there are assumptions in your task (e.g., "Assume this is for a formal audience"), make them clear in your prompt.</p>

    <h3>3. Control Output Length</h3>
    <p>Specify the desired length of the response, whether you want it short and concise or long and detailed.</p>
    <pre>
      Example: "Provide a detailed explanation of machine learning in 500 words."
    </pre>

    <h3>4. Avoid Open-Ended Questions</h3>
    <p>Open-ended questions may lead to unclear or overly vague responses. Try to be as specific as possible.</p>

    <h3>5. Use Temperature and Max Tokens</h3>
    <p>Experiment with adjusting the temperature and max tokens parameters to fine-tune the creativity and length of the output. A lower temperature (e.g., 0.2) will make the model more focused, while a higher value (e.g., 0.8) will make the output more creative.</p>

  <section id="best-practices">
    <h2>Best Practices</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Test Your Prompts:</strong> Try different variations and refine them based on the output.</li>
      <li><strong>Leverage GPT-4’s Strengths:</strong> GPT-4 excels at tasks like language generation, code completion, creative writing, and more.</li>
      <li><strong>Be Clear About Constraints:</strong> If there are constraints (e.g., time, format), mention them explicitly in your prompt.</li>
    </ul>
